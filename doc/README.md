# Portability and documentation

A Modern C++ GNU compiler, g++ 4.9.2 or above, and a recent cmake, 3.1 or above, are the minimum. As well a valid *boost* library is supposed to be installed.

Mock servers are basically a bunch of **nodejs** and **go** scripts, so those languages are needed if you plan to execute or modify them. The recommended way to install **nodejs** and **go** is using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) if possible.

## Containers

Some [Dockerfiles](https://www.docker.com/) are provided to relieve the burden of installing. For example, getting a [documentation server](https://github.com/jimmidyson/docker-nginx-busybox). One option to manage those *Docker* containers on *OSX* and *Windows* might be [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/)

As well you can go directly for [Linux Containers](https://linuxcontainers.org) or mix both containers technologies. Visit [learning tools](https://github.com/lowescott/learning-tools/tree/master/lxd) for further instructions and related [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) files.

### NGINX server

A very simple **Dockerfile** is provided in the *doc* folder following [nginx example](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/nginx/)

         cd <project git folder>/doc
         docker build -t nginx/doc .
         docker run --name nginx_doc -d -p 8080:80 nginx/doc

**Note:** If you happen not to work on **Linux**, you should first install some *Linux Virtual Machine* as **docker server**. One option is to let **Kitematic** deal with that detail and use its *Docker CLI*.

## Platforms 

Several platforms were tested to some extent: 

### DEB Linux Type 

Regarding to documentation, *doxygen*, *latex*, *graphviz* and *plantuml.jar* are needed. For example, if you work with **Xubuntu** 15.04 or its **Docker** equivalent, the following commands might do the trick for you:
    
          sudo apt-get -y install git build-essential libboost-all-dev 
          sudo apt-get -y install doxygen doxygen-latex openjdk-8-jdk graphviz
          sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:george-edison55/cmake-3.x
          sudo apt-get -y update
          sudo apt-get -y install cmake
          sudo apt-get -y upgrade
          sudo mkdir /opt/plantuml && sudo chmod a+wr /opt/plantuml
          wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/plantuml/files/plantuml.jar/download \
               -O /opt/plantuml/plantuml.jar
          
If you want to use latest *compiler*, you can use [an extra repository](http://askubuntu.com/questions/618474/how-to-install-the-latest-gcurrently-5-1-in-ubuntucurrently-14-04): 

          sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchan-r/test
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install gcc-5 g++-5

But then you might want to [compile newer *boost* libraries](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html) with that compiler.


### RPM Linux type 

Another typical Linux platform is **CentOS**. Their [*gcc*](https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-install-gcc-on-centos-6) and [*cmake*](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/cmake.html) are very conservative, even for *CentOS 7*, so compile newer ones from **source code** might be a possibility:

#### CMake:  

Download *tar.gz* with latest version and *untar* its source code

          cd <building directory>
          ./bootstrap --prefix=/opt/cmake --mandir=/opt/cmake/man --docdir=/opt/cmake/doc
          make
          sudo make install

#### Compiler: 

It's going to take long so try to use all the cores you got

          mkdir ~/sourceInstallations
          cd ~/sourceInstallations
          svn co svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/tags/gcc_5_1_0_release/
          cd gcc_5_1_0_release/ 
          ./contrib/download_prerequisites
          cd ~/sourceInstallations
          mkdir gcc_5_1_0_release_build/
          cd gcc_5_1_0_release_build/
          ../gcc_5_1_0_release/configure --enable-lenguages=c,c++ --prefix=/opt/gcc \
                                         --program-suffix=-5 --disable-multilib 
          make -j <number of cores> 
          sudo make install

          cd /usr/bin
          sudo ln -s /opt/gcc/bin/gcc-5 gcc-5
          sudo ln -s /opt/gcc/bin/g++-5 g++-5

#### Boost: 

A long compilation that needs to [be told where](http://www.boost.org/build/doc/html/bbv2/overview/configuration.html) to get the proper [toolset](http://hnrkptrsn.github.io/2013/02/26/c11-and-boost-setup-guide/). 

          cd <folder with source code>
          cp tools/build/example/user-config.jam .

Don't forget to edit  *user-config.jam* to point to **g++-5**, i.e., *using gcc : 5 : /opt/gcc/bin/g++-5*

          using gcc : 5 : /opt/gcc/bin/g++-5
          :
          <dll-path>/opt/gcc/lib64:/opt/gcc/boost/lib
          <harcode-dll-paths>true
          <cxxflags>-std=c++14
          <cxxflags>-Wl,-rpath=/opt/gcc/lib64:/opt/gcc/boost/lib
          <linkflags>-rpath=/opt/gcc/lib64:/opt/gcc/boost/lib
          ;

**Note:** Not all the targets might be created. If some of the missing ones are required for your apps, try to hack *boost* compilation scripts.

          ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/opt/gcc/boost --with-toolset=gcc
          sudo ./b2 -j8 install toolset=gcc-5 --prefix=/opt/gcc/boost \
                    threading=multi define=BOOST_SYSTEM_NO_DEPRECATED stage release

**Note:** Take into account when compile with 'g++-5' on one Linux platform that got its own previous compiler version, you should let know to the **linker** where to get 'g++-5' libraries. Try to avoid **LD_LIBRARY_PATH** and use instead **RPATH**:

          g++-5 -pthread â€”std=c++14 -Wl,-rpath=/opt/gcc/lib64 <rest of options> 

In case of your linking against *boost* generates too many *auto_ptr* deprecated warnings:

          g++-5 -pthread -std=c++14 -Wno-deprecated -Wl,-rpath=/opt/gcc/lib64:/opt/gcc/boost/lib \
                -I/opt/gcc/boost/include -L/opt/gcc/boost/lib -lboost_program_options <rest of options.

**Hint:** If you generate those *cmake*, *gcc* and *boost* on one machine and then copy them onto another, remember that there is [**soft links** involved](http://www.golinuxhub.com/2013/12/how-to-preserve-symbolic-links-with-tar.html).

### OSX type  

In order to use *GNU* compiler instead of *XCode* **clang** one, there are several options. The one followed for this project was [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

**Note:** If you happen to work with *OSX* and *Homebrew*, don't forget to compile **boost** with the previous **gcc** compiler, not with the default *clang* one:

          brew install gcc
          brew install boost --cc=gcc-5

### Windows type 

As well there are several options to get your *GNU* chaintool ready on windows instead of *Visual Studio*. For example, [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and [MinGW](http://nuwen.net/mingw.html). 

Another option might be following [MSYS2](https://github.com/gtorrent/gtorrent-core/wiki/Building-on-Windows) instruction:

          pacman -Syu 
          pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-pkgconf make
          pacman -S git mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake-git

## Working with binaries & documentation 

Usual commands:

          mkdir build
          cd build
          cmake ..
          make
          make doc

Optionally you can invoke *make install* to install binaries or *make install_doc* / *make show* to install / preview documentation.

**Note:** If you happen to work with *OSX* and [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), don't forget to invoke *cmake* pointing to the **GNU** compiler:

          cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++-5 ..

**Note:** If you happen to work with *Windows* and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)/[MinGW](http://nuwen.net/mingw.html), don't forget to invoke *cmake* pointing to the **GNU** generator:

          cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ..

As well a script, called **show** or something similar, will be created in your *home* directory as a shortcut for generating & viewing documentation. Don't hesitate to use it as a *template* for your specific environment.

## Generate only documentation 

Similar commands to the previous ones, just the compiler is not required:

          mkdir build
          cd build
          cmake -DONLY_DOC=TRUE ..
          make doc

**Note:** If you happen to work with *Windows* and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)/[MinGW](http://nuwen.net/mingw.html), don't forget to invoke *cmake* pointing to the **GNU** generator:

          cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DONLY_DOC=TRUE ..

**Note:** If your **make** utility is not installed in the default place, define *CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL* 

          cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TOOL=<your location> -DONLY_DOC=TRUE ..

As well, if you installed the documentation utility with **make show**, you're supposed to able to recreate and view that documentation PDF though usual *ssh* connection with enabled X11:

          ssh -X <user>@<location> "./show"

**Note:** By default **make install_doc** or **make show** copy the documentation *PDF* with the default project name in your **home** directory. You can define that target file with:

          cmake <rest of options> -DDOC_PDF=<your path & name, ending in .pdf> ..

## IDE hints 

Apart from the omnipresent **vim**, a couple of *IDE* were used:

### Atom

Basically for **nodejs**, **go** and **markdown**

To use [Atom](https://atom.io) don't forget to install plugins for *markdown* and *html* previews. As well for *running make* files and edit *cmake* files.

**Note:** Two *Vim* plugins, *vim-mode* and *ex-mode*, might be downloaded if you're accustomed to *vim*.

**Note:** If you happen to be only interested on generation documentation from *cmake* generated *make* files, configure *doc* task at **make-runner** plugin when *build/Makefile* is selected.

### NetBeans

Basically for **java**, **c++** and **markdown**

To use [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org) don't forget to configure a *cmake* project with *custom* **build** folder. Add at that moment any extra customization in the command line used by *cmake* instruction. For example:

 - -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-5 for **OSX**
 - -DONLY_DOC=TRUE for only documentation on **Linux/OSX**
 - -G "MSYS Makefiles" for **Windows**
 - -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DONLY_DOC=TRUE for only documentation on **Windows**

**Note:** If you happen to use *jVi* plugin on *OSX*, don't forget to use "-lc" instead of just "-c" for its /bin/bash flag. 

**Note:** In order to launch *images* and *documentation* generation from **IDE**, add *image* and *doc* tasks when *build/Makefiles* is selected.

## Development details

In order to generate binaries & documentation, the following versions were used:
